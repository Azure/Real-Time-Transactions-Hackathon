# Challenge 5: Improving the AI

You may have found that sometimes the SemanticFunction works and provides an accurate result, and sometimes it appears to calculate things incorrectly or have flaws in its logic. 

In this challenge you improve the the capabilities in two ways:

- Improve the prompt text to reduce any dependency on the model's parametric knowledge (this is the knowledge the model has learned during pre-training) so that it only uses the data you supply and the user query in the processing.
- Improve the handling of numbers. Sometimes numbers are better handled with native code. You will need to improve SemanticFunction by leveraging the SequentialPlanner that uses a NativeFunction for numeric operations in addition to your SemanticFunction.
